# Frontier

Personal project that I have been thinking about some months ago. This project will be a web application, and I expect it to have be a project where basic knowledge of web applications is used (CRUDs, Databases, Web APIs, etc), and also be a fun application. Furthermore, I'm using React as frontend library and I'm trying to apply as much about React as I can (hooks, classes, redux). By the time I'm writing this, I'm continuing developing this project.
